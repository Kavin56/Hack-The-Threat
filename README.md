# Hack The Threat - Cybersecurity & AI Hackathon 🛡️🤖

## Project Overview 🌐🔍

This project is built as part of the "Hack The Threat" cybersecurity hackathon, focusing on AI-driven threat detection and security analysis. It consists of three main components:

1. **Demo Website (Testing Environment)** 🌍💻
   - Developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
   - Hosted on **Netlify** for easy deployment.
   - Used for testing various security vulnerabilities and resilience against cyber threats.

2. **Threat Classification System (Streamlit App)** 📊🔐
   - Built with **Streamlit** to analyze log files for security threats.
   - Implements **Generative AI techniques** to classify and visualize threats.
   - Allows users to upload log files for **real-time analysis**.
   - **AI Model:** Leveraging **Azure AI Studio** and OpenAI's **GPT-3.5-turbo-16k** for advanced threat classification.

3. **Mitigation Strategy Report Feature (Powered by Gemini Flash 1.5) 📑🛡️**
   - After detecting threats, the system **generates detailed mitigation reports**.
   - Provides actionable steps to **fix security vulnerabilities**.
   - Uses **Gemini Flash 1.5** for **threat impact analysis** and **risk mitigation planning**.
   - Generates AI-driven recommendations for improving cybersecurity.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Threat Classification:** Uses AI to detect and classify security threats in log files.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks website uptime and potential security breaches.
- **Automated Testing & Analysis:** Utilizes various tools for security assessments.
- **Mitigation Reports (Gemini Flash 1.5):** Generates AI-driven reports on how to address vulnerabilities.

## ⚙️ **Mitigation Strategy Report Feature (Gemini Flash 1.5)**

After threat detection, the **Mitigation Strategy Report** provides:
- **Risk Impact Analysis:** AI evaluates the severity of the detected threat.
- **Recommended Fixes:** Suggested actions to fix vulnerabilities.
- **Severity Rating:** AI assigns a risk score based on impact.

### **How to Run**
```bash
python generate_mitigation_report.py --logfile logs/security_logs.json
```

### **AI Model Used**
The **Mitigation Strategy Report** is generated using **Gemini Flash 1.5**, which provides **fast and efficient cybersecurity insights**.

### **Code Snippet (Gemini Flash 1.5 Integration)**
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="your-google-api-key")

model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-flash-1.5")

prompt = "Analyze the security log and generate a mitigation strategy report: <log_data_here>"

response = model.generate_content(prompt)

print(response.text)
```
